            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This website caters to the needs of researchers involved in writing research articles in their own field of research. The very purpose of carrying out a research program is to master in the selected area of research and contribute new knowledge, data and findings. It is also a commitment for any researcher to give back his/her expertise to the literature from where he/she starts the research work. Publication of research articles in high impact factor journals helps the researchers to climb the ladder of their profession. International journal publications are considered as indicators of the quality of research. Many institutions around the world give significant weightage for high quality papers during appraisal programs. The online lectures proposed through this website will help the researchers to organize their research data, identify the research focus and organize the paper to be submitted to a selected journal. Guidelines for selection of suitable journal for publication will also be provided in these lectures.</p>
